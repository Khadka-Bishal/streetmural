# Mural Gallery

## Project Overview

### Description

The Mural Gallery is a decentralized platform that allows artists to submit their artwork, specifically murals, and engage with the community through voting. This project leverages Web3 technologies to create a transparent and community-driven art gallery where users can showcase their creativity, receive feedback, and gain recognition.

### Features

- **Artist Submissions**: Artists can submit their murals along with descriptions and artist information.
- **Voting System**: Community members can upvote or downvote murals, allowing the most appreciated artworks to rise to the top.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Utilizes IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for storing images, ensuring that the artwork is permanently available and not reliant on a single server.
- **Community Engagement**: Users can interact with the artwork and artists, fostering a sense of community and collaboration.

### Inspiration

The Mural Gallery was inspired by the need for a platform that empowers artists and allows them to connect with their audience in a meaningful way. Traditional art galleries often limit exposure to a select few, whereas this platform democratizes access to art by allowing anyone to participate and vote on their favorite pieces.

### What's New in Web3

This project embraces the principles of Web3 by:

- **Decentralization**: By using IPFS for storage, the project ensures that no single entity controls the artwork, promoting freedom of expression.
- **Transparency**: The voting system is transparent, allowing users to see how many votes each mural has received, fostering trust within the community.
- **Ownership**: Artists maintain ownership of their work, and the platform does not take a cut of their earnings or exposure, unlike traditional galleries.
